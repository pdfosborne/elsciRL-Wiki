## What is elsciRL?

**elsciRL (pronounced L-SEE)** is an abbreviation of our mission: 

<div align="center">
 <i>"Everything can be automated using Language and Self-Completing Instructions in Reinforcement Learning".</i>
</div>

To achieve this, **elsciRL** offers a novel framework and infrastructure for accelerating the development of language based Reinforcement Learning solutions.

This is also known as *AI agents* in relation to Large Language Model development (e.g. ChatGPT).
