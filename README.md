## What is elsci?

**elsci (pronounced L-SEE)** is an abbreviation of our mission: 

<div align="center">
 <b><i>"Everything can be automated using Language and Self-Completing Instructions".</i></b>
</div>

To achieve this, **elsci** offers a novel framework and infrastructure for accelerating the development of language based Reinforcement Learning (RL) solutions.

This has also been known as *AI agents* but we notably do not require the problem to already contain language.

See the [Getting Started](<./Documentation/I - Introduction/1 - Getting Started.md>) for a first time user guide to applying the Python library.

## What Makes the Wiki Open Source? 

The primary aim of elsciRL is to accelerate research in the Language and Reinforcement Learning domain. In many cases research can be fragmented by short-term paper submissions. Therefore, we believe it to be a fundamental requirement to improve how we collectively share knowledge as a global network of researchers. 

Therefore, we encourage academics who are new to the domain to freely use the knowledge contained in this Wiki for their projects by making it accessible to all. In turn, we ask that once projects are completed and publicly available the research notes used to complete new developments is contributed to the community. 

**Specifically, the Wiki provides:**
1. Beginner guides for new users
2. Information to academics new to the space on how they can contribute
3. A centralized set of applications that can be searched and filtered
4. Complete documentation for using the elsciRL software
5. Literature studies on a range of topics
6. References with summaries and ready to copy citations
7. A list of notable people to follow and their contributions to the domain

Lastly, the [documentation website](https://elsci.org/) is a direct display of the notes contained in this repository so as to streamline the contribution to the community.


## Download the Wiki

The elsciRL Wiki is written using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and backed-up through GitHub as an open-source documentation site. 

If you wish to download the documentation for personal use:

1. Download the [elsciRL-Wiki](https://github.com/pdfosborne/elsciRL-Wiki/tree/main) (click the *Code* button > *Download ZIP*)
2. Unzip the Vault to a local directory (e.g. inside Documents)
3. [Download Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/download)
4. Open the Obsidian software
5. Select the *Open folder as Vault* option and then the *elsciRL-Wiki* folder 

See [New Contributors Guide](<./Become a Contributor.md>) for more information on contributing to the open-source development of this project.

### Obsidian Configuration

By default, not all formatting will work without the correct plugins but they can be setup by:
1. Overriding the configuration folder in *Obsidian>Files and Links settings* to this folder *.obsidian-git* (see image below)
2. Lastly, restart obsidian

We also use a set of custom css snippets that you can enable in settings > appearance > CSS snippets at the bottom.
