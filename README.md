## What is elsciRL?

**elsciRL**  is new framework for incorporating language into Reinforcement Learning (RL) that accelerates problem solving and extracts valuable datasets.

This puts us in a new AI space between the previous Reinforcement Learning libraries and recent generative AI language breakthroughs. 

A principle challenge of Reinforcement Learning is that there is currently no standard approach to designing a language based Reinforcement Learning solution. Instead, individual applications are purpose built, requiring both extensive Reinforcement Learning and software experience and rarely can be applied to another problem without significant remodelling effort. **elsciRLâ€™s** mission is to solve this.

The **elsciRL** framework separates the responsibilities of a Reinforcement Learning solution so that as much as possible can be applied by domain experts that may even be non-technical. 

To achieve this, we provide:

1. An open-source software to apply our framework with 'off the shelf' solutions
2. A centralized repository of applications and examples
3. A benchmarking suite to evaluate new methods 
4. Documentation for all experience levels
5. An open-source Wiki for the acceleration of language based reinforcement learning research
6. A public Discord server for the community to connect and collaborate
