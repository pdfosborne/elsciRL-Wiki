# References

Central resource for references used in this work.

## Adding Citations

We use the Zotero Integration plugin and a set of templates. 

Once setup, you can simply import a citation from your Zotero database and it will format the reference to be used in other notes. 


## Reference Database Loom

The reference database is generated using the [DataLoom](https://dataloom.xyz/) obsidian plugin plugin.

The table can be filtered and sorted based on research requirements. Entries are grouped by type (published academic work, articles, ArXiv papers, etc.) and then sorted by year and citations (where possible).
