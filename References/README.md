### Reference Database Loom

The reference database is generated using the [DataLoom](https://dataloom.xyz/) obsidian plugin plugin.

The table can be filtered and sorted based on research requirements. Entries are grouped by type (published academic work, articles, ArXiv papers, etc.) and then sorted by year and citations (where possible).
