> Treasure Hunter was introduced by Cˆote ́ et al. (2018) as part of the TextWorld formalization and inspired by a classic problem to navigate a maze to find a specific object. The agent and objects are placed in a randomly generated map. A coloured object near the agent’s start location provides an indicator of which object to obtain provided in the welcome message. A straightforward reward signal is defined as positive for obtaining the correct object and negative for an incorrect object with a limited number of turns available.
