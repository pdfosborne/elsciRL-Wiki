Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data

Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) enhances reasoning in large language models. Absolute Zero introduces a new RLVR paradigm where a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without external data. The Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR) self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability using a code executor for validation and verification. AZR achieves SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks without external data, outperforming models relying on human-curated examples. AZR is effective across different model scales and model classes.
