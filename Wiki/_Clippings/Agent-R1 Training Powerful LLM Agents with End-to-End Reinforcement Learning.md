# Agent-R1: Training Powerful LLM Agents with End-to-End Reinforcement Learning

Agent-R1 is an open-source framework designed to accelerate research and development at the intersection of RL and Agent. It employs End-to-End reinforcement learning to train agents. Developers define domain-specific tools and reward functions.

**Key Features:**

*   Multi-turn Tool Calling
*   Multi-tool Coordination
*   Process Rewards
*   Custom Tools and Environments
*   Multiple RL Algorithms
*   Multi-modal Support

**Get Started:**
