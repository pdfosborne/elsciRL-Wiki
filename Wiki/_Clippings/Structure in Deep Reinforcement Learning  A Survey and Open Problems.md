# Structure in Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey and Open Problems

Reinforcement Learning (RL), bolstered by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), has shown success in many applications. However, its use in real-world scenarios with unpredictable dynamics, noisy signals, and large state/action spaces is limited. This is due to poor data efficiency, limited generalization, lack of safety guarantees, and absence of interpretability.

To improve performance, incorporating structural information is a promising approach. Various RL sub-fields have proposed methods for inductive biases. This survey unifies these methodologies, highlighting the role of structure and classifying methods into patterns. This provides insights into structured RL challenges and lays groundwork for a design pattern perspective on RL research, aiding in developing more effective RL algorithms.
